SUMMARY = "Light-weight PKCS#11 library for using the SmartCard-HSM"
DESCRIPTION = "This module has been initially developed to support the \
integration of a SmartCard-HSM in embedded systems with a little footprint. \
Rather than using a PC/SC daemon to manage attached card readers and token, \
the smaller Card Terminal API (CT-API) can be used."
